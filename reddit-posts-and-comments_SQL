/*Problem #1
Suppose you're working for Reddit as an analyst. Reddit is trying to optimize its server allocation 
per subreddit, and you've been tasked with figuring out how much comment activity happens once a 
post is published.

Use your intuition to select a timeframe to query the data, as well as how you would want to 
present this information to the partnering team. The solution will be a SQL query with assumptions 
that you would need to state if this were asked in an interview. 

You have the following tables:

Table: posts
Column Name | Data Type | Description
id            integet     id of the post
publisher_id  integer     id the user posting
score         integer     score of the post
time          integer     post publish time in unix time
title         string      title of the post
deleted       boolean     is the post deleted?
dead          boolean     is the post active?
subreddit_id  integer     id of the subreddit

Table: comments
Column Name |  Data Type | Description
id             integer     id of the comment
author_id      integer     id of the commenter
post_id        integer     id of the post the comment is nested under
parent_comment integer     id of parent comment that comment is nested under
deleted        integer     is comment deleted?

Given the above, write a SQL query to highlight comment activity by subreddit. 
This problem is intended to test how you can thing through vague/open-ended questions.*/

SELECT 
  COUNT(id) as "Total Comments",
  COUNT()
FROM comments as c
INNER JOIN posts as p
ON c.post_id = p.id
WHERE 
  p.deleted = FALSE,
  p.dead = FALSE,
  c.deleted = FALSE
